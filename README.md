# Module-into-module-plugin
Плагин для вставки модуля в другой модуль DIVI. 
использование shortcode


USING THE PLUGIN
Now that your plugin is up and running, head over to your Divi Library and create the section or module you’d like to insert somewhere else. You can of course use items in the library that have been saved there from existing posts or pages. Next, locate the ID of this item. The two easiest ways to find an ID are:

1.By hovering over the edit link in the library.

2.The second is to find it in the URL of the section or module while you’re editing it.

Now that you’ve located the ID, all you need to do now is insert the shortcode [showmodule id=”InsertIDhere“] whereever you want to use it. Just remember that that you need to put it in a container that supports shortcodes. I’ve tested it in a number of places including a Widget area, a Divi Tab Module, and a Divi Text Module at it worked beautifully every time.
